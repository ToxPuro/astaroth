make -j
./ac_run -b # To run P2P benchmark
./ac_run -t # To run P2P verification
srun <flags> ./mpirun # To run MPI benchmark and verification. Note: requires that the user spawns exactly one MPI task per GPU. For example with 2 nodes with 4 GPUs each: Spawn a total of 8 tasks, 4 tasks per node and allocate 4 GPUs per node. srun is a part of the Slurm Workload Manager. On systems where Slurm is not available, one should use mpirun or equivalent.



Switching between strong and weak scaling tests:
    - There is a flag "#define BENCH_STRONG_SCALING (1)" in both src/standalone/benchmark.c and src/core/device.cc.
    - Set this flag to 1 for strong scaling tests, or 0 for weak, and recompile.
